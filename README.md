# conferences
A list of conferences (and selected papers) that have made a big impact on the development of Bezoku
## First UD Conference - https://universaldependencies.org/udw17/
Notable for being the first conference on UD with big names and topics that are still relevant today.
## The second LT4ALL conference - https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000392741 
Bezoku's Ian Gilmour had a small talk at this excellent event with its focus on low resource and indigenous communities
## The fourth Syntaxfest conference - https://syntaxfest.github.io/syntaxfest25/
Bezoku attended and attended most of the workshops. Empirical findings on monolingual models and the ongoing challenges in annotation quality were highlights.
## The 19th Linguistic Annotation workshop - https://sigann.github.io/LAW-XIX-2025/program.html
We did not attend this one, but papers including "The revision of linguistic annotation in the Universal Dependencies framework: a look at the annotatorsâ€™ behavior" are excellent
## Please suggest other noteworthy conference on the field of UD / low resource and indigenous languages
